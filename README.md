# HardWHERE
  Construction sector can be considered as one of the the biggest industries in Sri Lanka. 
Over the past few decades construction sector has experienced a vast development. 
So that there are many new service providers, customers and sellers have emerged in this sector. 
But they all communicate through traditional methods and people face difficulties in finding what they want. 

  In sectors such as electronics, properties and automobile we could find what we need through the Internet. 
But being one of the biggest sectors, construction sector does not have such a way to find things easily. 
Also it differs from place to place. 

  In our project we develop a web platform, so that we could find a solution for the above difficulties. 
For an example, if a person needs to build his house and he needs to know the prices of the materials, where he could buy them, etc. 
So he could visit our site and search for the items and contact the dealers instantly. 
This would help him to manage the cost and find what he needs very easily. 

  So, the main goal of the project HardWHERE is to build a web based, 
unified platform for the construction sector where material/ equipment dealers, 
related service providers can advertise their items and customers can search for what they want. 
Also we provide the capability of contacting the dealer or service provider via sms and phone calls.
